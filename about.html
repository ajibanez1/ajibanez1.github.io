     <h1>About Angel</h1>
     <p>Hi, I am Angel Ibanez, I’m a student at the University of Rhode Island and I’m majoring in computer science
         bs. I chose computer science since I have always been fascinated by computers ever since my brother let me play 
         minecraft when I was really young.<br>
        I like a lot of stuff but my favorites have to be sports, and music. For sports I don’t really play them but I
         like to watch them especially Basketball and soccer. My favorite being soccer. I have watched it ever since I 
         was a kid and my favorite team is Real Madrid and my favorite player is Cristiano Ronaldo. For music, I am 
         very open to all kinds of music but my favorite genre has to be hip hop and my favorite artist is Kanye West
